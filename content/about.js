  Who am I? I'm a front-end developer who is passionate about Javascript, 
  building great user experiences, fighting for simplicity over complexity, 
  constantly learning and someone who strives to mentor and share with other 
  developers around me (so, hopefully, they'll mentor and share with me).
`,`
  My interests primarily lie in design and implementation of web apps, 
  whether desktop or mobile, single-page applications or otherwise. 
  Although I primarily focus on front-end Javascript, 
  I have plenty of experience writing node.js applications and SAAS solutions.
`,`
  I've developed with a number of frameworks, such as AngularJS, ExtJS, JQuery 
  along with ReactJS and its virtual-dom relatives. I enjoy learning new frameworks, 
  libraries and programming philosophies. I strive for simplicity, favor composition, 
  strongly work towards a component based architectures.
`,`
  Outside the web, I have a number of interests and hobbies (how shocking), most of my
  time (and income) I spend working or fixing my race car. Other than that, I love
  the mountains - snowboarding in the winter or hiking otherwise.
