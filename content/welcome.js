  Hello, hello...

  So... you somehow landed on this weird piece of the internet? Welcome!
  It's just something I did in my free time, nothing fancy or useful actually....

  Anyhow, there are a couple of things you can do - type a command and press 'Enter'.
  In some cases, there might be more than 1 page to see, 
  feel free to navigate using the arrow keys 'Left' and 'Right'.

  Keep in mind that the number of commands is really limited,
  in the future I might add more, but for now that's all folks!

  Why not start by typing 'help'?
